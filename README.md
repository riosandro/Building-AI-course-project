Building AI for blinded people

Summary
My project is about build a glasses that helps blinded people to have a better life 

Background
There are many blinded people around the world that canâ€™t have a normal life because of his disability, but nowadays the AI can solve this problem. The idea is create glasses that guide blind people in almost everything that the person does in his daily life.  
How is it used?
This AI would work with smalls sensors and mini cameras in front, back, left and right of the grasses that detect everything around the person that is wearing them, the glasses will also have hearing aids adapted on them, to the person hearing all the instruction that the AI tell to the person, what is in front of him, what is coming  toward him, were hi has to turn, right or left, were hi has to stop, were there is a traffic light, if the traffic light is in red or green, if the person is waiting for a cab, train or a bus the AI can detect the vehicle an can let the person know the distance of the car and tell him that he can rise his arm to stop the car. The AI can also read, a book, newspaper, recipe etc. 

Challenges
I know that this will be a big challenge because we need an autonomous AI that collect information of every situation every day and learn o give a better service to his owner.
Nowadays we have autonomous car that drive alone and there are many problems to solves with the autonomous AI, but I hope that with the researches every day we will find a solution for all this problems
